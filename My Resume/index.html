				<p> What makes me paint is color. A color can bring about a feeling and emotion like the melody or lyrics of a song. It wasnâ€™t until well into my twenties that I first discovered painting. Growing up writing music, I drew many parallels to the soothing nature of placing a brush stroke on canvas to the creative aspect of writing a note to the melody of a song.</p>
				<p>
				</p>
				<p>While a song puts music to the words around me, my paintings convey a melody that no words can fully capture. And thus, I discovered the beauty of painting-- as a way to express those emotions and experiences that fall just beyond the tip of my tongue. I tend to paint when I cannot find words to express how I feel; and while I do love expressing myself in words, my paintings often reflect the darker, more intimate shades of my soul that my words cannot.</p>
				<p>
				</p>
				<p> Growing up in Boston, New York City, and Los Angeles, I draw from many experiences and colorful lifestyles to create what I see and feel around me.  People, especially those close around me, inspire me and so I naturally gravitate toward portraiture; but there is a whimsical, dreamlike quality to my work that is often ominous in nature. This quality weaves through many of my paintings like a melody weaves through a song. I draw inspiration from such artists as Van Gogh, Picasso, and my real life friends.. They are perhaps my most influential source of inspiration and raw emotion.</p>
				<p>
				</p>
				<p>The following pieces represents the last few years of my life, when painting was the only clear way I could express myself. From the tragedy of a fire, to the muse of friends, to the wonderful moments of weekends on Cape Cod, these are the moments that have shaped me and inspired me as an artist.</p>
				<p>
				</p>
				<p>I hope you enjoy my work.</p>
